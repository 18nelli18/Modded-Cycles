# AGENTS.md — tools/

The Python build, one generator per mod, the ColdFire sources, and the emulation proofs. Read the root
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) first. Method and safety rules in full: [`notes/05-methode-patch.md`](../notes/05-methode-patch.md);
platform and ISA pitfalls: [`notes/03-plateforme-coldfire.md`](../notes/03-plateforme-coldfire.md).

## Conventions

- Python 3, standard library for everything that builds or flashes (`build.py`, `mtlib/`, `gen_flasher_tweaks.py`,
  `ref_mainos.py`): users run them without installing anything. Only the generators of code mods and the proofs
  under `emu/` may need `unicorn`, `numpy` and the m68k toolchain.
- Docstrings and comments in **French**, like the rest of the folder. The module docstring explains what the mod does,
  where its code lives, the note it comes from, and the command line to run it.
- Addresses are ColdFire VAs of OS 1.13. Section 3 offset = `VA - 0x40000400` (`build.BASE`).
- Detect the cross toolchain as the existing generators do:
  `next((c for c in ("m68k-linux-gnu-", "m68k-elf-") if shutil.which(c + "gcc")), "m68k-linux-gnu-")`.
  Compiled code is built with `-mcpu=54418`. Pin the compiler version used in the note when output bytes depend on it.

## A generator: `gen_<mod>.py`

Copy the shape of `gen_tempo_max.py` (data only) or `gen_trig_hold.py` (assembled code in a freed sprite mask):

- `--cycles model-cycles_OS1.13.syx` (and `--syntakt Syntakt_OS1.42.syx` if needed); refuse a file whose section 3
  SHA-256 differs from `device.json`.
- Read the stock bytes and **check them** before producing each write; the `old` bytes always come from the official
  image, never typed by hand.
- Write `../tweaks/model-cycles_OS1.13/NN-<id>.json` with `json.dumps(tweak, indent=1, ensure_ascii=False) + "\n"`.
- `--check` regenerates in memory and compares with the committed file (exit 1 if different). Every generated file in
  the repo must pass `--check`.
- Apply the result with `build.apply_writes` before writing it, so a bad `old` fails here and not in the build.

## Where code can live

Free space is scarce and every byte of it is accounted for in a note. Before taking any, read the notes that use it
and check the writes of **every** other tweak for overlaps.

- **Freed sprite masks** (`sprites.py`, notes/14 §5, notes/32 §11): a sprite is redirected to an identical mask
  (`sprites.redirect_write`), freeing its own. Already used: `0x4015c044` (6ch-usbup stubs, trig-hold in front),
  `0x4016cae8` (Syntakt engines' boot hook at the start, arpeggiator menu after it), `0x4018a788`, `0x40189930`,
  `0x4018a220` (arpeggiator), `0x40183118`, `0x40185018`, `0x40185968`, `0x40185c58` (sample-preview, shared with
  chord-keys, which excludes Model-TG: two tweaks may share a mask only if they can never be built together). In all,
  21 47×47 masks (376 bytes each, one constructor constant each, `0x400ac2b2`..`0x400b133e`) are identical to the kept
  `0x40172220` and can be freed the same way (notes/46 §7: 22 such sprites, where notes/32 §11 counted eleven).
  `sprites.py` lists six, so 15 are still unused here, but open PRs (chord-keys, the multiline browser, djd_oz's mods)
  claim them all: check their tweak files before taking one.
- **Payload appended to the image** and copied at boot to SDRAM (`0x43000000`, notes/17; Model-TG uses
  `0x46700000`, notes/31): for large code, at the cost of a boot hook shared with the Syntakt engines.
- **In place**: rewrite the function you change when the new code fits (tempo-max's LFO loop, trig-preview's 3 bytes).
  Prefer this whenever possible.
- Mod settings that must survive a save go in unused bytes of the pattern or project structures, proven unused
  (the arpeggiator uses byte +512 of the pattern track, notes/32 §4).
- Two tweaks may write the same bytes only if they write them **identically**; otherwise declare `conflicts`.

## Safety rules for code in the firmware

- Hook with a detour (`jmp stub`, `nop` padding); the stub replays exactly what the moved instructions did and
  returns with the registers the following code expects. Document that contract at the top of the `.S`.
- No branch, jump or stored pointer may target the inside of a hook's padding (frozen logo / `VEC:04`).
- Code reachable from an interrupt or re-entrantly must not keep its state in a single global; save and restore every
  register it touches; no waits or blocking calls.
- The audio interrupt is the tight spot: the stock OS already spends about 77 % of each 0.67 ms audio block there
  (notes/23). Measure the cost of anything added to the voice loop or the audio path, keep it out of there when you
  can, and check the load governor (notes/25, 30, 36) with `emu/test_governor.py`.
- USB audio timing is fixed by `usb_steady.py` (notes/35); Model-TG and the Syntakt engines share it. Reuse the shared
  writers (`usb_steady.py`, `voice_loop.py`, `gov_asm.py`, `sprites.py`) instead of copying their bytes.

## Proofs: `emu/test_<mod>.py`

- Run the **OS's own code** in Unicorn (`emu/mcengine.py` for the voice loop, `emu/emac.py` for exact EMAC, existing
  tests for event loops, keys, MIDI, USB), on the stock MAIN OS **and** the patched one, and show the difference the
  mod makes and that nothing else changes.
- Check the writes against the stock bytes and against all other tweaks (no overlap), then run with the other mods
  applied: `--with 6ch-usbup,model-tg-st,syntakt-tg-sd-cp-toy-bits-swarm,arp,trig-hold,tempo-max --syntakt …`.
- Print one line per check (`ok` / `FAIL`) and exit non-zero on any failure. State the run time in the docstring if it
  is long.
- When a proof finds the stock OS misbehaving (as tempo-max's LFO above 351.6 BPM), keep that check: it documents why
  the patch exists.

## Shared scripts you will regenerate

- `gen_flasher_tweaks.py`: the `FEATURES` list (cards of the web flasher). Add the new mod there, then run it; `--check`
  in validation. Card `status` is `"experimental"` until Maxime tests it.
- `check_overlaps.py [--git REF …]`: no firmware needed. Two tweaks that can be installed together never write the
  same bytes (except the same whole write, or one applied on top of the other through `requires`), every write is
  well formed, and the payloads of every installable set chain up (`at`, `END_LIMIT`, `dest`). With `--git` it reads
  branches and checks them together (the open PRs). This is what lets the flasher check mods one by one (notes/49).
- `ref_mainos.py --cycles … --syntakt … [--check]`: rewrites `REF_MODS` (each tweak's writes and payload hashes) and
  `REF_MAINOS` (the MAIN OS of a sample: each card alone, every pair, the largest combinations) in
  `docs/flasher/app.js`. Rerun after any change to a tweak or to `FEATURES`; it reads the card rules like `app.js`.
- `webflash_smoke.js`: asserts the list and order of tweaks and cards and their tags; update it with the new card.
- Adding a Syntakt engine: `CATALOG` in `gen_syntakt_engines.py`, then `--all` and `--all --tg`,
  `gen_flasher_tweaks.py`, `check_overlaps.py`, `ref_mainos.py`, and a proof per new tweak (see BUILD.md).
